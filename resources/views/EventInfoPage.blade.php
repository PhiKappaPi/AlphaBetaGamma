						The Alumni Society would like to invite you to the long-lasting tradition of the 2016 PKP Annual Golf Tournament in Arundel, Quebec happening on June 11th, 2016. For years, this event has brought all brothers back to an environment of comradery and joy, allowing everyone to hop on back to memory lane on that single day. 
						</p>
						<p>
						This is an opportunity for actives and alumni to spend some time together to smoke cigars, have a few cold ones, sharpen golf skills and have a good old PKP time. This is the first year that families are invited, and we are very excited about this inclusion!
						</p>
						We have many activities open to actives and alumni; you can choose to partake in one or all of them.
